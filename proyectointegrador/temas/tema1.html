                <p>The first MPCs were designed by <a href="/wiki/Roger_Linn" title="Roger Linn">Roger Linn</a>, who had designed the successful <a href="/wiki/Linn_LM-1" title="Linn LM-1">LM-1</a> and <a href="/wiki/LinnDrum" title="LinnDrum">LinnDrum</a> drum machines in the 1980s. Linn aimed to create an intuitive instrument, with a grid of pads that can be played similarly to a traditional instrument such as a keyboard or drum kit. Rhythms can be built not just from samples of percussion but samples of any recorded sound. 
                </p>
                <p>The MPC had a major influence on the development of <a href="/wiki/Electronic_music" title="Electronic music">electronic</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hip_hop_music" title="Hip hop music">hip hop music</a>. It led to new sampling techniques, with users pushing its technical limits to creative effect. It had a democratizing effect on music production, allowing artists to create elaborate tracks without traditional instruments or recording studios. Its pad interface was adopted by numerous manufacturers and became standard in DJ technology. 
                </p>
                <p>Notable users of the MPC include the American producer <a href="/wiki/DJ_Shadow" title="DJ Shadow">DJ Shadow</a>, who used an MPC to create his influential 1996 album <i><a href="/wiki/Endtroducing....." title="Endtroducing.....">Endtroducing</a>;</i> the American producer <a href="/wiki/J_Dilla" title="J Dilla">J Dilla</a>, who disabled its <a href="/wiki/Quantization_(music)" title="Quantization (music)">quantize</a> feature to create signature "off-kilter" rhythms; and the rapper <a href="/wiki/Kanye_West" title="Kanye West">Kanye West</a>, who used it to compose several of his best-known tracks. MPCs continue to be used in music, even with the advent of <a href="/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation" title="Digital audio workstation">digital audio workstations</a>.

                <h2><a id="titulo1">Development</a></h2>
                <p><By the late 1980s, <a href="/wiki/Drum_machine" title="Drum machine">drum machines</a> had become popular for creating beats and <a href="/wiki/Loop_(music)" title="Loop (music)">loops</a> without musicians, and <a href="/wiki/Hip_hop_music" title="Hip hop music">hip hop</a> artists were using <a href="/wiki/Sampler_(musical_instrument)" title="Sampler (musical instrument)">samplers</a> to take portions of existing recordings and create new compositions.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup> <a href="/wiki/Groovebox" title="Groovebox">Grooveboxes</a>, machines that combined these functions, such as those by <a href="/wiki/E-mu_Systems" title="E-mu Systems">E-mu Systems</a>, required knowledge of music production and cost up to $10,000.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>The original MPC, the MPC-60, was a collaboration between the Japanese company <a href="/wiki/Akai" title="Akai">Akai</a> and the American engineer <a href="/wiki/Roger_Linn" title="Roger Linn">Roger Linn</a>. Linn had designed the successful <a href="/wiki/Linn_LM-1" title="Linn LM-1">LM-1</a> and <a href="/wiki/LinnDrum" title="LinnDrum">LinnDrum</a>, two of the earliest drum machines to use <a href="/wiki/Sampling_(music)" title="Sampling (music)">samples</a> (prerecorded sounds).<sup id="cite_ref-:02_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:02-2">[2]</a></sup> His company Linn Electronics had closed following the failure of the <a href="/wiki/Linn_9000" title="Linn 9000">Linn 9000</a>, a drum machine and sampler. According to Linn, his collaboration with Akai "was a good fit because Akai needed a creative designer with ideas and I didn't want to do sales, marketing, finance or manufacturing, all of which Akai was very good at".<sup id="cite_ref-:1_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:1-3">[3]</a></sup> 
                </p>
                <p>Linn described the MPC as an attempt to "properly re-engineer" the Linn 9000.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_3-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:1-3">[3]</a></sup> He disliked reading instruction manuals and wanted to create an intuitive interface that simplified music production.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup> He designed the functions, including the panel layout and hardware specification, and created the software with his team; he credited the circuitry to a team led by English engineer David Cockerell. Akai did the production engineering, making it "more manufacturable".<sup id="cite_ref-:1_3-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:1-3">[3]</a></sup> The first model, the MPC60 (MIDI Production Center), was released on December 8, 1988,<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> and retailed for $5,000.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup> It was followed by the MPC60 MkII and the MPC3000, and the MPC2000, which Linn did not work on.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> 
                </p>
                <p>After Akai went out of business in 2006,<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> Linn left the company and its assets were purchased by Numark.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:2-7">[7]</a></sup> Akai has continued to produce MPC models without Linn.<sup id="cite_ref-:1_3-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:1-3">[3]</a></sup> Linn was critical, saying: "Akai seems to be making slight changes to my old 1986 designs for the original MPC, basically rearranging the deck chairs on the <i>Titanic</i>."<sup id="cite_ref-:2_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:2-7">[7]</a></sup><sup class="noprint Inline-Template"><span style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Link_rot" title="Wikipedia:Link rot"><span title="&nbsp;Dead link tagged March 2022">dead link</span></a></i>]</span></sup>

                <p>Instead of the switches and small hard buttons of earlier devices, the MPC has a 4x4 grid of large pressure-sensitive rubber pads which can be played similarly to a keyboard.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup> The interface was simpler than those of competing instruments; it can be used without a studio and connected to a normal sound system. According to VOX "most importantly, it wasn't an enormous, stationary mixing panel with as many buttons as an airplane cockpit".<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>Whereas artists had previously sampled long pieces of music, the MPC allowed them to sample smaller portions, assign them to separate pads, and trigger them independently, similarly to playing a traditional instrument such as a keyboard or drum kit.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup> Rhythms can be built not just from percussion samples but any recorded sound, such as horns or synthesizers.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup> 
                </p>
                <p>The MPC60 only allows sample lengths of up to 13 seconds, as sampling <a href="/wiki/Computer_memory" title="Computer memory">memory</a> was expensive at the time and Linn expected users to sample short sounds to create rhythms; he did not anticipate that they would sample long loops.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_7-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:2-7">[7]</a></sup> Functions are selected and samples are edited with two knobs. Red “record” and “overdub” buttons are used to save or loop beats.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup> The MPC60 has an <a href="/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display" title="Liquid-crystal display">LCD</a> screen and came with <a href="/wiki/Floppy_disk" title="Floppy disk">floppy disks</a> with sounds and instruments.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup>

                <p>Linn anticipated that users would sample short sounds, such as individual notes or drum hits, to use as building blocks for compositions. However, users began sampling longer passages of music.<sup id="cite_ref-:12_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:12-8">[8]</a></sup> In the words of Greg Milner, the author of <i>Perfecting Sound Forever</i>, musicians "didn't just want the sound of <a href="/wiki/John_Bonham" title="John Bonham">John Bonham's</a> kick drum, they wanted to loop and repeat the whole of '<a href="/wiki/When_the_Levee_Breaks" title="When the Levee Breaks">When the Levee Breaks</a>'."<sup id="cite_ref-:12_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:12-8">[8]</a></sup> Linn said: "It was a very pleasant surprise. After 60 years of recording, there are so many prerecorded examples to sample from. Why reinvent the wheel?"<sup id="cite_ref-:12_8-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:12-8">[8]</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>The MPC's ability to create percussion from any sound turned sampling into a new artform and allowed for new styles of music.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup> Its affordability and accessibility had a democratizing effect; musicians could create tracks on a single machine without a studio or <a href="/wiki/Music_theory" title="Music theory">music theory</a> knowledge, and it was inviting to musicians who did not play traditional instruments or had no music education.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:3_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:3-9">[9]</a></sup> Musicians learnt how to push its technical limits; for example, the producer <a href="/wiki/Om%27Mas_Keith" title="Om'Mas Keith">Om'Mas Keith</a> would record samples at high speeds, then slow them to their original pitch on the MPC, allowing him to record samples longer than the MPC's maximum.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup>
                </p>
                <p>According to <i>Vox</i>, "The explosion of electronic music and hip hop could not have happened without a machine as intimately connected to the creative process as the MPC. It challenged the notion of what a band can look like, or what it takes to be a successful musician. No longer does one need five capable musicians and instruments."<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup> MPCs continue to be used in music, even with the advent of <a href="/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation" title="Digital audio workstation">digital audio workstations</a>, and fetch high prices on the used market.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup> The 4x4 grid of pads was adopted by numerous manufacturers and became standard in DJ technology.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_1-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:0-1">[1]</a></sup>
